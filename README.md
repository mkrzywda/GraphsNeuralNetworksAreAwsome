# Graphs are Awesome!

Hello!

My name is Maciej Krzywda. I created this repository to share a set of links that I found valuable and inspiring. 
I hope that you'll like it!

So sum up **Graphs are Awsome** is a space in you will be can find articles/sample of code about **_Graphs_** in every area of IT from Databases via Graphs Aglortihms to Machine Learning.
